  <h2>Definition:</h2>
  <p>Diaspora means “to scatter” in Greek, but today we use the term to describe a community of people who live outside their shared country of origin or ancestry but maintain active connections with it.
  A diaspora includes both emigrants and their descendants.!</p>
    
  <p>In English, when uncapitalized the word diaspora may be used to refer to refugee or immigrant populations of other origins or ethnicities living "away from an established or ancestral homeland".</p>
